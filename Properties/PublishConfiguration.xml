## Service Parking Upgrades

### Supported Buildings
* LandFill01
* Hospital01
* PoliceStation01
* BusDepot01
* TaxiDepot01

Simily click on the building and youll see the upgrade there. If you already have a building placed, youll likley need to replace the building once the pack is installed.

## NOTE: Please read the upgrade description, some upgrades have road's that go with them and are required to be placed in a specific location. 

Upgrade costs are NOT final and I would appreciate your feedback on this! 
Only recommend using on wealthy large cities else will look out of place and wont be cost effective.
